NAME
    HTML::LBI - DreamWeaver HTML Library Module

SYNOPSIS
      use HTML::LBI;

      $html = new HTML::LBI(
                           filename => 'file.lbi',
                           path => '/path/to/file'
                           );

DESCRIPTION
    A perl module for use with CGI scripts that opens a Macromedia
    Dreamweaver library file (.lbi) and returns the resulting HTML code
    snippet.

METHODS
  Creation

      $lbi = new HTML::LBI("file.lbi");
  
      $lbi = new HTML::LBI(
                           filename => 'file.lbi',
                           path => '/path/to/file'
                           );

    Creates a new HTML::LBI object and loads HTML from the Dreamweaver
    library 'file.lbi' (can specify a relative or absolute path). Returns
    the HTML from the library, which could then be printed to STDOUT.

DIAGNOSTICS
    Library File $file not opened:
        (F) The library file was not opened properly. This message is stored
        in $HTML::LBI::errmsg
