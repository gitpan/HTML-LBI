  Description:
	A perl module for use with CGI scripts that opens a 
	Macromedia Dreamweaver library file (.lbi) and returns
	the resulting HTML code snippet.

  
  Installation:
      Unzip/tar the archive:
      	tar xvfz HTML-LBI-1.01.tar.gz
	
      Create the makefile
      	perl Makefile.PL
      
      Make the module (must have root access to install)
      	make
	make test
	make install

  Construction:
	  use HTML::LBI;

	  $html = new HTML::LBI("file.lbi");

  Use:
	Create a new instance of HTML::LBI as above by passing
	a pathname to the library file (absolute or relative)
	to the constructor.  The constructor will return
	the HTML from the .lbi file, which can then be printed out.

  Errors:
	Should the library file fail to open an error will be set
	in $HTML::LBI::errmsg
